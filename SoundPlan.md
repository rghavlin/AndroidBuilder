Adding sound effects and music to your game should be relatively straightforward! Your current setup is already well-positioned for audio integration.

Difficulty Assessment: Easy to Moderate
Why it's manageable:

Web Audio API Support - Modern browsers have excellent audio support
Existing Asset System - You already have an image loading system that can be adapted for audio
Event-Driven Architecture - Your game uses events, making it easy to trigger sounds
Modular Design - Sound can be added as a separate system without disrupting existing code
Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Basic Sound System (Easy)

Create an AudioManager class similar to your ImageLoader
Add sound effects for common actions (movement, item pickup, zombie encounters)
Use HTML5 Audio API for simple playback
Phase 2: Advanced Features (Moderate)

Background music with looping
Spatial audio (sounds get quieter with distance)
Audio settings/volume controls
Music that changes based on game state (combat vs exploration)
File Structure
You'd add audio files to client/public/audio/ with subfolders like:

client/public/audio/
├── effects/
│   ├── footstep.mp3
│   ├── item_pickup.wav
│   └── zombie_growl.wav
└── music/
    ├── ambient.mp3
    └── tension.mp3
Integration Points
GameContext - Add audio state management
Entity Actions - Trigger sounds on movement, attacks, etc.
UI Components - Add volume controls to game settings
Event System - Your existing event emitters can trigger audio
The most complex part would be implementing spatial audio and dynamic music transitions, but basic sound effects and background music are quite achievable with your current architecture.
