[11:21:05 PM]=== Phase 5C Verification (Backpack Visibility) ===
[11:21:05 PM]Test 1: Initial state (no backpack)...
[11:21:05 PM] ✅ No backpack equipped - should show "No backpack equipped"

[11:21:05 PM] ✅ Backpack equipped successfully

[11:21:05 PM]Test 3: Grid slot size consistency...
[11:21:05 PM] ℹ️ Visual check required:
[11:21:05 PM] - Backpack grid slots should match ground grid slot size
[11:21:05 PM] - Both grids should use same pixel dimensions from GridSizeContext
[11:21:05 PM]Test 4: Unequipping backpack...
[11:21:05 PM] ✅ Backpack unequipped successfully
[11:21:05 PM] - Item placed in: backpack-default
[11:21:05 PM] ✅ Backpack visibility toggled off
[11:21:05 PM] ℹ️ Check BackpackGrid UI: should show "No backpack equipped" again
[11:21:05 PM]--- Phase 5C Status ---
[11:21:05 PM]✅ Phase 5C Implementation Complete
[11:21:05 PM]Backpack grid visibility toggles based on equipment state
[11:21:05 PM]Grid appears when backpack is equipped
[11:21:05 PM]Placeholder shown when no backpack equipped
[11:21:05 PM]
[11:21:05 PM]Quick test commands:
[11:21:05 PM]• Create and equip backpack:
[11:21:05 PM] const { Item } = await import("./game/inventory/Item.js");
[11:21:05 PM] const bp = new Item({instanceId:"bp1", defId:"container.backpack", name:"Test Backpack", width:3, height:4, equippableSlot:"backpack", containerGrid:{width:8, height:10}, traits:["equippable","container"]});
[11:21:05 PM] window.inventoryManager.equipItem(bp, "backpack");
[11:21:05 PM]• Unequip: window.inventoryManager.unequipItem("backpack")
Please  fix the getBackpackContainer() / updateDynamicContainers() / getContainerGrid() interaction so that an equipped backpack's container is properly accessible.
