Looking at the logs and the implemented changes, I can see the exact issue causing the "Loading game..." freeze when clicking "New Game".

Root Cause Analysis
The problem is that Phase 1's implementation is incomplete. Here's what's happening:

CameraContext.jsx correctly exposes camera: cameraRef.current ✅
GameMapContext.jsx still has a critical issue - it's missing the hoveredTile state that MapCanvas expects ❌
MapCanvas.jsx is trying to destructure hoveredTile from useGameMap() but it's not being provided
The Specific Issue
Looking at the logs:

[MapCanvas] Render check: {
  isInitialized: true,
  gameMapExists: true, 
  cameraExists: true,
  ...
}
The game IS initializing correctly - you can see zombies spawning, the player being placed, and the camera being positioned. But MapCanvas never renders because it's missing the hoveredTile property.

In MapCanvas.jsx line ~15:

const { gameMap, handleTileClick, handleTileHover, hoveredTile } = useGameMap();
But in GameMapContext.jsx, the hoveredTile state was removed in the Phase 1 changes, and it's not being exposed in the context value.

The Fix
The GameMapContext needs to provide the hoveredTile state that MapCanvas expects. The issue is that during Phase 1, the hoveredTile state was removed but MapCanvas still depends on it.

Looking at the current GameMapContext.jsx, I can see the context value doesn't include hoveredTile:

const contextValue = {
  gameMap: gameMapRef.current,
  worldManager: worldManagerRef.current,
  mapTransition,
  // ... methods
  // ❌ Missing hoveredTile
};
But MapCanvas expects it:

const { gameMap, handleTileClick, handleTileHover, hoveredTile } = useGameMap();
Solution
The GameMapContext needs to maintain the hoveredTile state and expose it in the context value. This is UI state that should trigger re-renders when the user hovers over different tiles.

The freeze occurs because MapCanvas can't destructure hoveredTile from the context, causing a JavaScript error that prevents the component from rendering.

The fix is to add back the hoveredTile state to GameMapContext and ensure it's properly exposed in the context value, as this is legitimate UI state that should trigger re-renders for hover effects.
