Looking at the recent chat history and the current state of the map transition implementation, I can provide an assessment of where we stand with the map transition fix.

Current Status Analysis
What's Working:

✅ The fromJSONSelective() method has been successfully implemented in GameMap.js
✅ Game loading still works correctly (as confirmed in your message)
✅ The selective entity restoration infrastructure is in place
What's Still Broken:

❌ Map transitions are still not working properly
❌ The WorldManager.js loadMap() method is still using the old GameMap.fromJSON() instead of the new selective method
❌ Map transitions are still creating duplicate players
Assessment: Are We Ready for the Next Phase?
No, we should complete the current phase first. Based on the analysis document and Phase 4 goals, we need to finish implementing the selective loading for map transitions before moving on.

What's Missing (Phase 1 Completion)
The analysis document clearly outlined that we need to:

✅ DONE: Create the selective entity restoration method (completed)
❌ MISSING: Update WorldManager.js to use selective loading for transitions
❌ MISSING: Create a dedicated map transition loading method
Specific Issues to Fix
Looking at the WorldManager.js code in the context, the loadMap() method on line ~75 is still using:

const gameMap = await GameMap.fromJSON(mapData.serializedMap);
This should be using fromJSONSelective() with excludeEntityTypes: ['player'] for map transitions, while keeping the full fromJSON() for save/load operations.

Recommendation
Before moving to the next phase, we should:

Complete Phase 1 by implementing the map transition-specific loading in WorldManager.js
Test that map transitions work without creating duplicate players
Verify that save/load still works correctly
Then proceed to the next phases outlined in the analysis
The foundation is solid with the selective restoration method, but we need to wire it up properly in the WorldManager to complete the map transition fix as originally planned.
