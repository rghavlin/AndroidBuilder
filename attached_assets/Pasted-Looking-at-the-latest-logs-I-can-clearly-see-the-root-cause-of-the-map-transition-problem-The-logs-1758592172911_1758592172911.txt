Looking at the latest logs, I can clearly see the root cause of the map transition problem. The logs reveal a critical sequence that explains why the player spawns at the top instead of the bottom:

Key Evidence from the Logs
Camera Position During Initialization: The logs show the camera moving from Y position 39 → 38 → 31 → 30 → 28 → 27 → 26 → 25 → 23 → 17, which indicates continuous downward camera movement that should have been stopped.

Final Camera Position Issue: After initialization completes, the camera ends up at (17, 120) but the player should be at (17, 123). This 3-unit discrepancy is the smoking gun.

Double Initialization: The logs show GameInitializationManager completing initialization TWICE:

[GameInitializationManager] State transition: world_population → complete
[GameContext] Initialization state changed to: complete
This happens twice in the logs, indicating multiple initialization managers are running.

Missing Game Objects: After the second initialization completion, the logs show:

[MapCanvas] Missing components: {"gameMap":false,"camera":false}
This suggests the contexts are getting reset or overwritten.

Root Cause Analysis
The problem is multiple GameInitializationManager instances running simultaneously. Here's what's happening:

First Initialization: Creates player at correct position (17, 123) and camera at (17, 120)
Second Initialization: Overwrites the contexts, but with incorrect positioning
Camera Animation Still Running: The animation system from the first initialization continues running, moving the camera upward
Position Conflict: When map transition occurs, the player gets placed based on the incorrect camera position rather than the correct spawn position
The Critical Issue
The logs show that during the gradual migration (Phase 2), there are multiple player instances and multiple initialization managers being created. This is evident from:

GameInitializationManager creating multiple instances with different IDs
Player instances being tracked globally showing duplicates
Context references getting overwritten during the second initialization
Solution Direction
The issue is not with the map transition logic itself, but with the initialization system running multiple times. This causes:

Conflicting player references between contexts
Animation systems from different initialization cycles interfering
Camera position calculations based on stale/incorrect player positions
The cancelMovement() function is failing because there are multiple animation loops running from different initialization cycles, and it can only cancel one of them.

This explains why the player ends up at the wrong spawn position - the map transition is working correctly, but it's receiving incorrect player position data from the conflicted context state.

To fix this, you need to ensure that only one GameInitializationManager instance runs during the entire application lifecycle, and prevent the double initialization that's causing the context conflicts.
