What I agree with

No south-edge transition on map_002
Yep. Your generator (or template) gives you the north-edge transition on map_001, but nothing is stamping the reciprocal south-edge transition on map_002. The detection code (checkTransitionPoint) expects a transition tile; it isn’t there. This is why you can’t go back south.
✅ Fix: stamp the reciprocal transition immediately after a successful transition (this belongs in WorldManager, not the template).

Load puts you back on the first map because “current map” isn’t restored
Also true. Your save must include currentMapId (or an equivalent pointer), and the load path must set it before wiring contexts. If fromJSON doesn’t restore it, you’ll land on the default (map_001).

What’s missing (and matters for your symptoms)

Your post-transition re-save was crashing (and may still be brittle)
From your recent logs:

[GameMapContext] Re-saving map to WorldManager with player included...
Map transition error: ReferenceError: targetMapId is not defined


That means the snapshot of map_002 never got committed after placing the player and centering the camera. Even if currentMapId is saved, the map data you reload is stale (no player there, no reciprocal transition).
✅ Fix: use a guaranteed ID when re-saving:

const finalMapId = result?.mapId ?? worldManagerRef.current.currentMapId;
worldManagerRef.current.saveCurrentMap(gameMapRef.current, finalMapId);


Do this after adding the player and stamping the reciprocal transition.

Reciprocal transitions should be stamped by WorldManager (cross-map concern)
The Replit note implies the generator should make south tiles. That’ll “work,” but it blurs responsibilities. Phase-4/UDG want single-concern components:

Generator: builds a standalone map (no cross-map knowledge).

WorldManager: owns world graph/links.
✅ Add a helper like:

ensureReciprocalTransition({ fromMapId, toMapId, entryDir, spawnX, topY=1, bottomY }) {
  const map = this.getMap(toMapId);
  if (entryDir === 'north') {
    map.setTransitionTile(spawnX, bottomY, {
      direction: 'south',
      nextMapId: fromMapId,
      spawnPosition: { x: spawnX, y: topY }
    });
  }
  // handle other directions similarly
}


Call it right after executeTransition returns the new map and before the final saveCurrentMap.

End-to-end order that fixes both issues

Inside executeMapTransition (or equivalent):

await cancelMovement()

worldManager.saveCurrentMap(oldMap, oldMapId)

const result = await worldManager.executeTransition(transitionInfo)

setGameMap(result.gameMap)

Move player → remove from old tile, set position to spawn, add to new map

Camera: setWorldBounds, then centerOn(spawn)

Stamp reciprocal transition on the new map (via WorldManager)

Re-save the new current map with a valid id (see snippet above)

Clear dialog/flags

Save/Load checklist (to verify)

Save: GameSaveSystem.toJSON includes worldManager: { maps..., currentMapId } and the live player state.

Load: WorldManager.fromJSON reconstructs all maps and sets currentMapId. After that:

GameContext should set gameMapRef from worldManager.getCurrentMap(),

place/validate the player on that map’s saved coordinates,

and then set camera bounds/center.
