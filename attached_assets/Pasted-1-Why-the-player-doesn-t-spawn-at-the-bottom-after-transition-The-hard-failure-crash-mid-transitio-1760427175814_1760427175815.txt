1) Why the player doesn’t spawn at the bottom after transition
The hard failure (crash mid-transition)

In client/src/contexts/GameMapContext.jsx, inside executeMapTransition(...), there’s a call to setGameMapState(result.gameMap), but setGameMapState doesn’t exist in this provider. You have a setGameMap(...) helper (which sets the ref and bumps a mapVersion counter), but not setGameMapState.

You can see the call here (around where you log “Removing player from old map…”):

gameMapRef.current = result.gameMap;
setGameMapState(result.gameMap); // ❌ ReferenceError


Your logs line up with this perfectly:

“Removing player from old map…” ✅

Immediately after: Map transition error: ReferenceError: setGameMapState is not defined ❌

Then: “Map transition failed, keeping dialog open” ❌

Impact: the function throws before it:

puts the player onto the new map at the spawn point,

centers the camera,

increments mapVersion to force a structural re-render, and

clears the mapTransition dialog.

So the UI keeps showing the old map (player stuck at the top), and the transition “never finishes” from the app’s perspective.

Minimal fix: replace that undefined call with the real setter you already have, or just rely on mapVersion:

- gameMapRef.current = result.gameMap;
- setGameMapState(result.gameMap); // ❌
+ setGameMap(result.gameMap);      // ✅ (this updates the ref + bumps mapVersion)


(If you prefer to assign the ref manually there, then immediately setMapVersion(v => v + 1) after you’ve successfully added the player and centered the camera.)

A migration landmine you already started to fix

Earlier you hit ReferenceError: camera is not defined in the same function. You’ve since introduced a cameraOperations parameter (with setWorldBounds and centerOn) and the wrapper in GameContext now passes those in. Good—that’s the Phase-4 way. The only remaining blocker for the spawn is the setGameMapState crash above.

2) Why saving “stops working” after a transition

There are two issues here—one user-visible, one structural.

2a) User-visible: you crash before committing the transition

Because executeMapTransition throws before it calls setMapTransition(null) and before it bumps mapVersion, the UI doesn’t switch to the new map. If you try saving right then, it can look like “it saved nothing” when you reload—because the previous state is still on screen, and the transition never committed in context.

In short: the crash makes it appear that saves don’t work. Fixing the crash will make your save/load look correct again.

2b) Structural: the WorldManager snapshot is stale (no player)

Your WorldManager persists a serialized snapshot of each map in its maps collection. During transition:

If the target map already exists, you call loadMapForTransition(targetMapId) which deliberately excludes players (to avoid duplicates).

If the target map does not exist, you generate it and immediately save it via saveCurrentMap(gameMap, targetMapId)—that snapshot is also without any player (because you haven’t added the player yet).

Then, in GameMapContext.executeMapTransition, you (should) add the player to the new gameMap and proceed—but you never re-save that updated map back into WorldManager after the player is added.

Impact: when you later call GameSaveSystem.saveToLocalStorage, it serializes both:

gameMap (the live gameMapRef.current, which would include the player if the transition had completed), and

worldManager (whose maps entries do not include the player for the current map).

That mismatch can bite you on load (and certainly on later transitions), and is a second reason the save/load flow feels inconsistent post-transition.
