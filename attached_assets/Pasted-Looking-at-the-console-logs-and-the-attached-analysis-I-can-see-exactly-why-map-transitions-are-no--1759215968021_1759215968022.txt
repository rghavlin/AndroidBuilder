Looking at the console logs and the attached analysis, I can see exactly why map transitions are no longer executing after the recent changes. Let me investigate the issue:

Root Cause Analysis
From the console logs, I can see that:

Player movement to transition tile works correctly: The player successfully moves to position (17, 0) which is the transition tile
Transition detection works: The log shows [GameMapContext] Transition point detected: {"direction":"north","position":{"x":17,"y":0},"nextMapId":"map_002","spawnPosition":{"x":17,"y":123}}
But no transition execution follows: There are no subsequent logs showing map transition execution
The Problem
Looking at the previous changes made to GameMapContext.jsx, I can see the issue. The handleMapTransitionConfirm function signature was changed to require additional parameters:

const handleMapTransitionConfirm = useCallback(async (player, updatePlayerCardinalPositions, cancelMovement) => {
However, the MapTransitionDialog component is still calling it with the old signature (no parameters). Looking at the MapTransitionDialog component in the codebase:

<Button 
  type="button" 
  onClick={async () => {
    await onConfirm(); // <-- This calls handleMapTransitionConfirm with NO parameters
    onOpenChange(false);
  }}
>
The Issue
The handleMapTransitionConfirm function now expects (player, updatePlayerCardinalPositions, cancelMovement) as parameters, but it's being called without any parameters from the MapTransitionDialog. This causes the function to receive undefined for the player parameter, which makes this condition fail:

if (!player) {
  console.error('[GameMapContext] Cannot execute transition - no player available');
  return false;
}
Impact Assessment
This is a critical regression caused by the Phase 4 migration changes. The map transition dialog appears, but clicking "Yes" does nothing because the transition function immediately exits due to missing parameters.

Should We Fix This Now?
Yes, absolutely fix this now for these reasons:

Core Functionality Broken: Map transitions are completely non-functional
Migration Regression: This worked before Phase 4 and is a direct result of the migration
Testing Blocker: Can't test other aspects of the game without basic map transitions working
Simple Fix: The solution aligns with Phase 4 architecture goals
The Solution
The issue needs to be fixed in the GameContext's wrapper function that calls handleMapTransitionConfirm. Looking at the GameContext code, there should be a wrapper that gets the required player context functions and passes them to the GameMapContext function. The MapTransitionDialog should continue calling a parameter-less function, but that function should internally gather the required context data.

This is a straightforward parameter passing issue that broke during the migration to direct sub-context access. The fix maintains the Phase 4 architecture while restoring functionality.

Looking at the analysis, I can confirm the exact issue: handleMapTransitionConfirm was changed to expect parameters but the MapTransitionDialog is still calling it without any. The solution is to fix the wrapper function in GameContext that provides the required parameters.

The problem is in GameContext.jsx's handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper - it's not passing the required parameters to the GameMapContext function. Here's the fix:

client/src/contexts/GameContext.jsx
client/src/components/Game/GameScreen.tsx
Wait, I need to expose the wrapper function from GameContext. Let me fix that:

Now fix the GameScreen import:
