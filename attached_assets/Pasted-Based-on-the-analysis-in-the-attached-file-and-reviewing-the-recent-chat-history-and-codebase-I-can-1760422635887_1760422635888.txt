Based on the analysis in the attached file and reviewing the recent chat history and codebase, I can provide a comprehensive fix strategy for the map transition issues:

Root Cause Summary
The core problems are:

Animation interference: The player movement animation completes to position (17, 122) instead of the correct spawn (17, 123) because the animation calculated the final position based on the OLD map before the transition occurred.

Save corruption: Autosave captures a gameMap with 0 entities because the player is temporarily removed during transition, creating an inconsistent state.

Timing issues: The cancelMovement() is called but animation frames may still execute, overriding the spawn position.

Recommended Fix Strategy
Fix 1: Add Animation Cancellation with Proper Wait
In GameMapContext.jsx, modify executeMapTransition to cancel movement and wait for it to complete BEFORE any map operations:

// At the start of executeMapTransition, before any map operations
if (cancelMovement) {
  console.log('[GameMapContext] Cancelling movement before transition...');
  cancelMovement();
  // Wait for animation frame to fully stop
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150));
  console.log('[GameMapContext] Movement cancelled, proceeding with transition');
}
Fix 2: Use Player's Actual Position for Camera Centering
After placing the player on the new map, center camera on the player's ACTUAL coordinates instead of the spawn variable:

// After player is successfully placed
if (cameraOperations && cameraOperations.centerOn) {
  cameraOperations.centerOn(currentPlayerRef.x, currentPlayerRef.y);
  console.log(`[GameMapContext] Camera centered on player actual position (${currentPlayerRef.x}, ${currentPlayerRef.y})`);
}
Fix 3: Validate Map State Before Autosave
In GameContext.jsx, add validation to prevent saving empty maps:

const performAutosave = useCallback(() => {
  if (!isInitialized) return false;
  try {
    setIsAutosaving(true);
    
    // CRITICAL: Verify player is on map before saving
    const playersOnMap = gameMapRef.current?.getEntitiesByType('player') || [];
    if (playersOnMap.length === 0) {
      console.error('[GameContext] Autosave aborted - no player on map!');
      setIsAutosaving(false);
      return false;
    }
    console.log('[GameContext] Performing autosave with valid game state...');
    // ... rest of autosave logic
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[GameContext] Autosave error:', error);
    setIsAutosaving(false);
    return false;
  }
}, [isInitialized, turn, playerRef, gameMapRef, worldManagerRef, cameraRef]);
Fix 4: Remove the Conflicting Patch
The "PATCH" at the end of executeMapTransition is actually causing issues by re-placing the player after the animation has moved them. This should be removed since we're now:

Cancelling animation BEFORE transition
Using player's actual position for camera
Implementation Order
First: Add animation cancellation with wait at the START of executeMapTransition
Second: Change camera centering to use currentPlayerRef.x, currentPlayerRef.y instead of spawn variables
Third: Remove the PATCH code at the end of executeMapTransition
Fourth: Add autosave validation in performAutosave
This approach ensures:

Animation is fully stopped before transition begins
Player position is set once and remains consistent
Camera follows the actual player position
Only valid game states are saved
Would you like me to implement these fixes?
