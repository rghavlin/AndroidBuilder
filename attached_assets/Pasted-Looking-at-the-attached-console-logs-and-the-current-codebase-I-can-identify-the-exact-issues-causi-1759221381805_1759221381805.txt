Looking at the attached console logs and the current codebase, I can identify the exact issues causing the map transition problems. Let me analyze the key problems:

Root Cause Analysis
1. Multiple Player Instance Creation
The logs show a critical issue:

[Player] ðŸŽ® NEW PLAYER INSTANCE CREATED: player-1 at (17, 0)
[Player] ðŸ“Š TOTAL PLAYER INSTANCES CREATED: 2
[Player] ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ MULTIPLE PLAYER INSTANCES DETECTED!
2. Player Entity Missing from EntityMap

[GameMapContext] - Player in entityMap: MISSING
3. undefined setGameMapState Function

[GameMapContext] Map transition error: ReferenceError: setGameMapState is not defined
4. Player Position Mismatch
The logs show the player is being moved from (17, 124) to (17, 121), but the GameMap is trying to move from (17, 0) - indicating the player entity reference is disconnected from the actual player position.

Issues Identified
Issue 1: Undefined setGameMapState Function
In GameMapContext.jsx line 346, there's a call to setGameMapState(result.gameMap) but this function doesn't exist in the context.

Issue 2: Player Entity Duplication During Map Loading
When loading a saved map via GameMap.fromJSON(), it creates a new Player instance instead of using the existing player reference. This creates multiple player instances with the same ID but different positions.

Issue 3: Player Reference Disconnection
The player entity that the contexts are tracking is not the same instance that's stored in the GameMap's entityMap, causing position and movement inconsistencies.

Issue 4: Incorrect Spawn Position Logic
The spawn positions are being set correctly by WorldManager, but the player entity being moved is the wrong instance, so the movement fails.

The Cascade Effect
Map transition starts with correct player at (17, 124)
WorldManager loads the previous map and creates a new player instance at (17, 0)
The contexts still reference the old player instance at (17, 124)
When movement happens, it tries to move the old player instance, but GameMap only knows about the new instance
This causes the "entity not found" errors and position mismatches
The setGameMapState error prevents the transition from completing properly
Why This Happened
The previous fixes successfully enabled map transitions to execute, but introduced a fundamental problem: player entity reference management. The system now creates multiple player instances instead of maintaining a single, consistent player reference across map transitions.

The fix needs to:

Remove the undefined setGameMapState call
Ensure player entities are not duplicated during map loading
Maintain consistent player entity references across contexts
Properly handle spawn positioning with the correct player instance
This explains why:

Player stays at (17,0) after transition (wrong player instance)
Return transitions don't work (same issue)
Movement animations work but then reset (conflicting player references)
The core architectural principle being violated is single source of truth for the player entity - the contexts and GameMap are tracking different player instances.
