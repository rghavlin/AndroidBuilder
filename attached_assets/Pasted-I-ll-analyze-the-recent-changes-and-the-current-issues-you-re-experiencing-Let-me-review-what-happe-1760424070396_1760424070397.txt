I'll analyze the recent changes and the current issues you're experiencing. Let me review what happened with the previous solution and identify the problems.

Analysis of the Previous Solution
Looking at the implemented fixes and the new issues:

The Previous Solution Had Critical Flaws:

Fix 2 (Camera centering on actual position) - This is INCORRECT for map transitions because:

During a map transition, currentPlayerRef.x and currentPlayerRef.y still contain the OLD map coordinates
The camera tries to center on (17, 2) from the old map instead of the spawn position (17, 123) on the new map
This is why the camera doesn't move during transitions
The timing issue wasn't properly addressed:

The player position is updated AFTER the camera is centered
This creates a race condition where camera centers on stale coordinates
Fix 3 (Removing PATCH code) - This removal was CORRECT but incomplete:

The PATCH code was indeed causing duplicate placement
However, removing it exposed the camera centering bug
Why Load Game Camera Doesn't Update:

Looking at GameContext.jsx loadGame() function - it doesn't recenter the camera at all! The camera position from the previous game state remains.

Root Cause Summary
Map Transition Camera Bug: Camera centers on player's OLD position before player position is updated to NEW position
Load Game Camera Bug: No camera recentering happens during load
The previous solution made things worse by centering camera on stale player coordinates
The Correct Solution
The fixes need to be reordered and corrected:

During map transition: Update player position FIRST, THEN center camera on the updated position
During load game: Add explicit camera centering after loading
Keep the animation cancellation (that part was correct)
Keep the autosave validation (that part was correct)
No, the previous solution was NOT correct. It had the right ideas but implemented them in the wrong order, causing the camera to center on stale coordinates. Would you like me to implement the corrected solution?
