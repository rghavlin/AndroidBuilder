You're absolutely right in your analysis. Looking at the recent chat history and the problem we encountered, modifying GameMap.fromJSON() to skip player restoration was definitively the wrong solution. This was a classic example of fixing a symptom rather than addressing the root cause.

Root Cause Analysis
The actual map transition problem wasn't in GameMap.fromJSON() - it was in how the transition logic was handling the existing player entity before loading the new map. Let me break down what should have happened:

The Real Map Transition Flow Should Be:
Player moves to transition tile ‚Üí triggers transition dialog
User confirms transition ‚Üí transition process begins
Remove player from current map ‚Üí clean slate for map switching
Save current map state (without player) ‚Üí preserve world state
Load/generate target map ‚Üí using standard fromJSON() or generation
Add player to new map at spawn position ‚Üí complete the transition
What Was Actually Happening:
Player moves to transition tile ‚úÖ
User confirms transition ‚úÖ
Player remains on current map ‚ùå
Save current map state (with player still on it) ‚ùå
Load target map (which might also have a player from save data) ‚ùå
Try to add "another" player to new map ‚ùå
Result: Duplicate players üö®
The Correct Solution Architecture
1. Context-Specific Map Loading
Map transitions need their own loading path that's separate from game loading:

// For game loading (restore everything including player)
GameSaveSystem.loadGameState(saveData) ‚Üí calls GameMap.fromJSON(data)
// For map transitions (load map structure only)
WorldManager.loadMapForTransition(mapId) ‚Üí calls GameMap.fromJSONWithoutEntities(data)
2. Clean Player Management During Transitions
The transition logic should:

// BEFORE loading new map
currentMap.removeEntity(player.id)  // Clean removal
// AFTER loading new map  
newMap.addEntity(player, spawnX, spawnY)  // Clean addition
3. Separate Map Restoration Methods
We need two restoration paths:

Option A: Parameter-based approach

static async fromJSON(data, options = { includeEntities: true })
Option B: Separate methods (cleaner)

static async fromJSON(data)                    // Full restoration (game loading)
static async fromJSONMapOnly(data)             // Structure only (transitions)
Recommended Fix Strategy
Phase 1: Add Map-Only Loading Method
Create GameMap.fromJSONMapOnly() that restores terrain and static elements but skips entity restoration.

Phase 2: Fix Transition Logic
Update WorldManager.executeTransition() to:

Properly remove player from current map FIRST
Use the map-only loading method
Add player cleanly to the new map
Phase 3: Keep Game Loading Intact
GameSaveSystem.loadGameState() continues using full fromJSON() restoration.

Why This Approach is Superior
Separation of Concerns: Game loading vs map transitions are different operations
No Impact on Save/Load: Existing functionality remains untouched
Clear Intent: Method names make the purpose obvious
Maintainable: Each path has a single responsibility
The original fromJSON() modification was trying to make one method serve two masters, which violated the Single Responsibility Principle. The correct fix is to give each use case its own appropriate method.

This approach aligns with Universal Goals: it's modular, focused, and doesn't create the kind of cascading breakage we experienced with the previous "fix."
