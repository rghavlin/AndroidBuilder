Looking at the console logs and the codebase, I can see the exact issue causing the MapCanvas to show "Loading game components..." instead of rendering the map.

Root Cause Analysis
The issue is in MapCanvas.jsx - it's using the old useGame() hook pattern instead of the new direct sub-context access pattern that was implemented in the recent refactoring.

Key Evidence from Console Logs:
Initialization is successful: The GameInitializationManager completes successfully, all contexts get their data:

[GameMapContext] gameMapRef.current now: GameMap(35x125)
[PlayerContext] âœ… Player reference set: player-1 at (17, 123)
[CameraContext] cameraRef.current now: Camera at (17, 120)
MapCanvas can't access the data:

[MapCanvas] Render check: {"gameMapExists":false,"cameraExists":false,...}
[MapCanvas] Missing components: {"gameMap":false,"camera":false}
The Problem
MapCanvas.jsx is still using the old aggregated useGame() approach:

const { isInitialized } = useGame(); // Only initialization state from GameContext
But then it tries to access gameMap and camera from the useGame() hook, which no longer provides direct access to these refs. According to the new architecture, MapCanvas should use direct sub-context access.

Additional Issues Identified
MapCanvas hook usage inconsistency: The component imports all the direct context hooks but only uses useGame() for initialization state.

Missing context data flow: The new context system stores data in refs (not state), but MapCanvas is expecting them to be available immediately through the old useGame() aggregation.

Phase 1 migration incomplete: The comment says "Phase 1: Direct sub-context access" but the implementation doesn't match.

Required Fix
MapCanvas needs to be updated to use the Phase 1 direct sub-context access pattern like the other components:

// Instead of:
const { isInitialized } = useGame();
// Should be:
const { isInitialized } = useGame(); // Only for initialization state
const { player, playerFieldOfView, playerRenderPosition, isMoving } = usePlayer();
const { gameMap, handleTileClick, handleTileHover, hoveredTile } = useGameMap();
const { camera } = useCamera();
The MapCanvas component is the last major component that hasn't been migrated to the new direct sub-context access pattern outlined in StateMachineProject.md, which is why the map isn't loading despite successful initialization.

This aligns with the Universal Goals principle of Stay Focused - the component should only import what it needs from each specific context rather than relying on the aggregated useGame() hook.
