I'll analyze the issues you've mentioned by examining the code and recent changes.

Analysis of Issues
1. Equipment Slots Changed to Small Rectangles with Text Only
Looking at EquipmentSlot.tsx and EquipmentSlots.tsx, I can see the issue:

What happened: In the Phase 5 implementation, the equipment slots were changed from showing icons (like ðŸŽ’ for backpack, ðŸ‘• for upper body) to showing abbreviated text labels (like "PACK", "BODY", "LEGS").

Current code shows:

{isEmpty ? (
  <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground select-none">
    {label}  // Shows "PACK", "BODY", etc.
  </span>
) : (
  <span className="text-xs font-semibold text-accent select-none">
    {item.name.substring(0, 3).toUpperCase()}  // Shows first 3 letters of item name
  </span>
)}
Previous code (from chat history) showed icons with slot names below them.

The slots are also using fixedSlotSize * 0.8 for dimensions via inline styles, and the styling uses border-2 rounded instead of the previous approach with icons.

2. No Ground Grid Visible
Looking at GroundItemsGrid.tsx, the component should always show the ground grid. The issue is likely that:

The ground container might not be initialized properly
The getContainer('ground') call might be returning null
The InventoryContext might not have the inventoryManager properly initialized
The component shows "No ground container available" when groundContainer is null, but according to InventoryManager.js, the ground container should always be created in the constructor.

3. Dev Console Command for Equipping Backpacks
Looking at DevConsole.jsx, there are inventory demo commands available. The 'demo' or 'inventory demo' command creates items including backpacks, but you need to specifically equip them.

Answers to Your Questions
Q1: Why did equipment slots change?
The Phase 5 implementation replaced the icon-based display with text abbreviations. This was part of connecting the equipment slots to the actual InventoryManager state, but the visual design was changed in the process.

Q2: Dev console command for equipping backpacks?
Yes, you can use the dev console (press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I based on keyboard shortcuts):

// First run the demo to create items
> inventory demo
// Then you can manually equip items:
> window.inventoryManager.equipItem(window.testBackpack, 'backpack')
// Or create and equip a backpack directly:
const { createItem } = await import('./game/inventory/index.js');
const backpack = createItem('container', 'backpack', { id: 'test-bp', name: 'Test Backpack', containerGrid: { width: 8, height: 10 } });
window.inventoryManager.equipItem(backpack, 'backpack');
Q3: Why is there no ground grid?
The ground grid component exists but isn't displaying. This is likely because:

The InventoryContext's inventoryRef.current might not be initialized when the component first renders
The InventoryManager isn't being properly passed to the InventoryContext
There's a timing issue with initialization
The root cause is probably that the InventoryProvider creates a new InventoryManager, but the GameContext (which initializes the game) might be creating a separate one, causing a disconnect.

Summary
The issues stem from:

Visual regression: Phase 5 changed the equipment slot design from icons to text abbreviations
Initialization disconnect: The InventoryContext and game initialization might not be properly synchronized
Missing integration: The inventory system exists but isn't fully wired into the game initialization flow
These are integration issues that occurred during the phased implementation. The inventory system backend is correct, but the UI connection needs adjustment.
