Looking at the attached analysis and the current code, I can see the exact issue. The problem is indeed that handleMapTransitionConfirm was changed to expect parameters but the MapTransitionDialog is still calling it without any.

Let me investigate the current state:

GameMapContext.jsx - The handleMapTransitionConfirm function now expects: (player, updatePlayerCardinalPositions, cancelMovement)

GameContext.jsx - There's a wrapper function handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper that should provide these parameters, but looking at the current implementation, it's calling mapTransitionConfirm (the GameMapContext function) with the correct parameters.

GameScreen.tsx - The MapTransitionDialog is correctly using handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper

MapTransitionDialog.tsx - The dialog calls onConfirm() with no parameters

The issue appears to be working correctly based on the code I can see. Let me check the console logs more carefully...

From the logs, I can see that:

The game is initialized and running
Map transitions are detected: [GameMapContext] Transition point detected
But there are no subsequent logs showing the transition execution
Looking at the code flow, when a player steps on a transition tile, it should:

Detect the transition (✅ working - we see this in logs)
Set the mapTransition state (this should trigger the dialog)
User clicks "Yes" in the dialog
Call handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper
Which calls mapTransitionConfirm with proper parameters
The problem might be that the MapTransitionDialog isn't appearing, or the wrapper function isn't working properly. Since I cannot make changes right now as requested, let me explain what I believe the issue is:

Root Cause Analysis:

The issue is likely in the GameContext wrapper function. Looking at the current implementation in GameContext.jsx, the handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper function has this line:

const success = await mapTransitionConfirm(playerRef.current, updatePlayerCardinalPositions, cancelMovement);
But the GameMapContext's handleMapTransitionConfirm function signature is:

const handleMapTransitionConfirm = useCallback(async (player, updatePlayerCardinalPositions, cancelMovement) => {
The wrapper is missing the setPlayerPosition parameter that might be expected, or there could be a mismatch in the parameter order.

Investigation Results:

Transition Detection: ✅ Working (we see the log)
Dialog Trigger: ❓ Need to verify if dialog appears
Button Click: ❓ Need to verify if wrapper is called
Parameter Passing: ❌ Likely the root cause
The fix would involve ensuring the wrapper function passes all required parameters in the correct order to match the GameMapContext function signature, and that the wrapper function is properly exposed and used by the MapTransitionDialog.

Without being able to make changes now, I recommend checking:

Does the MapTransitionDialog actually appear when stepping on the transition tile?
Are there any console errors when clicking "Yes"?
Is the handleMapTransitionConfirmWrapper function being called at all?
The solution aligns with the Phase 4 architecture goals of using wrapper functions to bridge between contexts while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
